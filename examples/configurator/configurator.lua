-- Schema-driven GUI graph configurator for Modbus / Redis / SQL / Websocket workers.
--
-- The radapter config schema (the same tree `--schema` prints) is exposed to Lua
-- via the global schema(). We hand the relevant worker schemas to a QML window
-- (radapter's reusable WorkerGraph / WorkerConfigurator / SchemaForm components).
-- The window is a small graph editor: add workers, see them on a canvas grouped by
-- type (each with a badge of how many pipes touch it), click one to edit its config,
-- and connect two into a pipe. The authored model (objects + pipes) is shown live as
-- a declare-compatible config — ready for declare.build / declare.save_to.
--
-- Run (needs a Qt GUI):
--   build/bin/radapter --gui examples/configurator/configurator.lua

-- worker families this configurator offers (devices included so Modbus masters
-- can reference / create one)

    "RedisCache", "RedisStream",
    "Sql",
    "WebsocketServer", "WebsocketClient",
}

-- only the worker types the user picks directly (devices are reached via the ref
-- field's "New…" flow, so they need a schema but not a top-level entry)

-- Bespoke editors for complex fields can be supplied per "<WorkerType>.<field>" as a
-- QML file loaded by URL (the extension point for richer configurators). The Modbus
-- register/query editors ship with radapter and SchemaForm applies them automatically,
-- so none are needed here; pass extra ones via custom_forms if desired.
